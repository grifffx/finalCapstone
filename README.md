Cypher Project - cypher.py
This cypher program can take input from a file or keyboard. The user is prompted for a number between -20 and +20, followed by a sentence. The program then shifts each alphabetical character by for example 15 letters. So ‘a’ will become ‘p’. Letters are treated as cyclical. So ‘p’ will be coded to ‘e’ (the 10th letter after ‘p’ is ‘z’, so 5 letters after that will be ‘e’ because the cycle starts again.
